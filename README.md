## Overview
Eleven11 Crew is a web-based application designed to identify critical space safety gear in visual data from space stations. It utilizes a custom-trained YOLOv8 model to detect essential equipment such as O_2 cylinders, fire extinguishers, and toolkits. The application also includes a 3D exploration section where users can interact with astronaut and space station models. ðŸš€

## Features
- Image Analysis: Upload or capture an image for gear detection.

- Real-time Detection: Identifies objects with bounding boxes and confidence scores.

- Recognized Objects: Detects O_2 cylinders, fire extinguishers, and toolkits.

- Interactive 3D Models: Explore astronaut and space station models for visual context.

- Modern UI: Responsive frontend built with React.

- Robust Backend: REST API powered by Flask and YOLOv8.

## Tech Stack
### Frontend
1. React.js: For building the user interface.

2. TailwindCSS: For utility-first styling.

3. model-viewer / Three.js: For interactive 3D models.

4. Canvas API: For overlaying detection bounding boxes.

### Backend
1. Python 3.10+: Core programming language.

2. Flask: Web framework for the REST API.

3. YOLOv8 (Ultralytics): For the object detection model.

4. OpenCV: For rendering annotated images.
