BACKEND RESTART INSTRUCTIONS
============================

ISSUE: Process time showing "N/A" instead of actual timing

SOLUTION:
1. Go to the terminal where the backend is running
2. Press Ctrl+C to stop the current backend
3. Restart the backend with: python main.py
4. The backend now includes timing functionality

WHAT CHANGED:
- Added start_time = time.time() at the beginning of detection
- Added end_time = time.time() at the end of detection  
- Returns processing_time in milliseconds: "1234.56ms"

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Frontend will now show actual processing time instead of "N/A"
- Example: "PROCESS_TIME: 1500ms" instead of "PROCESS_TIME: N/A"

The backend code has been updated to include timing measurements.
Simply restart it to apply the changes!
